# A place to call home

Spacious, open living rooms at The Darcy are designed for both gathering and relaxation.  Living areas are centrally located and feature floor-to-ceiling windows, providing abundant light and air as well as spectacular views.

While some residences enjoy the solitude of sunsets to the west or the tree canopies to the south, others may view upon the urban theatre of Bethesda, one of the most vibrant communities in the country.

A select number of residences feature gas fireplaces and private terraces where residents can entertain friends or simply enjoy a good read and cup of coffee. While living areas embrace the outdoors, window treatments ensure privacy, giving residents variety and control of their environment.

## The Kitchen

With light filled, open kitchen layouts and island workspaces, kitchens in The Darcy are the prefect culinary and social space. Whether having cozy dinner at home or entertaining for a crowd, kitchens are equipped with the very best state-of0the-art appliances, including Bosch® or Thermador® integrated panel refrigerators, Bosch® dishwashers, and gas cook tops and ovens.

Ample custom cabinetry, granite counter tops and other unique options, such as wine coolers, built-in espresso machine, and warming drawers enhance daily living at The Darcy.

## Bathroom

Many residences feature soothing deep soaking tubs and provide the utmost comfort with spacious showers and integrated stone benches. Natural stone floors, millwork cabinetry, vanities, frameless-glass shower doors, custom lighting, and stone countertops are tailored for comfort.
